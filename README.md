# Personalized Nutrition Predictor

A **machine learning-powered application** to predict personalized nutritional requirements based on user health data. 
This project uses **Ridge Regression**, **Feedforward Neural Networks (FFNN)**, and **Random Forest Regressor (RFR)** 
to deliver accurate predictions. It features a user-friendly **Tkinter GUI** for seamless interaction, enabling data 
upload, model training, and predictions.

## Overview

The **Personalized Nutrition Predictor** addresses the limitations of generalized nutritional recommendations by using 
**machine learning and deep learning models**. It provides personalized caloric recommendations based on health metrics, 
activity levels, and dietary patterns. The GUI allows non-technical users to interact with the system effortlessly.
